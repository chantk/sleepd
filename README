sleepd is a daemon to to put a laptop to sleep if it is not
being used or if the battery is low.

You'll need to add the following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local.
# Start sleepd
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.sleepd ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.sleepd start
fi

You should then add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown.
# Stop sleepd
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.sleepd ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.sleepd stop
fi

You'll need to add the following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local. Alternatively, add them to /etc/rc.d/rc.M, after the acpid section:

	# Start sleepd
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.sleepd ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.sleepd start
	fi

You should then add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown. If you added the above section to /etc/rc.d/rc.M, add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.K and /etc/rc.d/rc.6 just before acpid:

	# Stop sleepd
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.sleepd ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.sleepd stop
	fi
